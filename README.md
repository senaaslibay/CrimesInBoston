# CrimesInBoston
With using Crimes in Boston dataset from Kaggle, i will try to write a python project which will predict to crimes. It is empty now but i will working on it and i wanted to share about the progress of this journey. The dataset which i will use for this project contains rows like crimes id, crimes code, district, report area, year, month, day, hour and street.
I think i have to visualize to this data and then decide to that which method i have to use..
I guess i will use Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and ect.
If u give me a feedback i will appreciate for this.
